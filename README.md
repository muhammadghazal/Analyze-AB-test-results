# A/B Testing Report – Conversion Impact Analysis of New Landing Page

## Overview

This project presents an in-depth A/B test analysis to measure the conversion impact of a newly designed landing page compared to the current version. The goal is to determine whether the new landing page produces a statistically significant improvement in conversion rates. The report details the experimental design, hypothesis testing, and key performance metrics used to determine the success of the new design.

## Project Components

- **Data Collection:**  
  Data was gathered from the landing page experiment. Two groups were established: the control group (current landing page) and the treatment group (new landing page).

- **Methodology:**  
  The analysis involved calculating conversion rates, performing statistical tests (e.g., Z-test) with a pre-defined significance level (α) to examine whether changes in conversion are significant, and computing confidence intervals around the metrics.

- **Visualization & Reporting:**  
  Results are presented via charts and tables that illustrate the distribution of conversions, comparison of key metrics between the two groups, and the overall impact on conversion performance.

- **Insights & Recommendations:**  
  The report concludes with actionable recommendations based on the statistical findings and business impact analysis, guiding future marketing and design decisions.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook (for analysis and report)

## How to Use

1. **Setup:** Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. For example:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
   ```
2. **Review Data:** Open the provided datasets and review the experimental design details.
3. **Run Analysis:** Execute the analysis notebook to reproduce the statistical tests and visualizations.
